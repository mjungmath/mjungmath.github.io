After reviewing the Hamiltonian formalism for classical mechanics, I will discuss two ways to generalize it to Laplace's equation. As we will see, the most obvious way of doing this leads to ugly equations that are hard to work with. Fortunately, there is a way of making these equations nicer using so-called Bridges regularization. I will end by briefly mentioning how I use this formalism in my research.
