It is a classical fact that for closed manifolds $$X$$ the homotopy classes of maps $$X^n\rightarrow S^n$$ are classified by their degree.
The Pontryagin-Thom construction provides a similar construction when $$X$$ and the sphere have also different dimensions, and thus generalizes the notion of degree.
In particular, the homotopy classes of maps $$X^{n+1}\rightarrow S^n$$ are in one-to-one correspondence with framed circles up to framed cobordism in $$X$$, and the corresponding set comes equipped with a group structure.
In this talk, we introduce the Pontryagin-Thom construction and the concept of framed cobordism classes, and we compute the group of homotopy classes of maps $$X^{n+1}\rightarrow S^n$$ in terms of geometric and topological information of $$X$$.
If time permits, we delve into some ideas of the proof, and discuss applications to vector bundles.
