In this talk, I will give a short introduction into differential topology and its usefulness in various fields of mathematics. We will talk about homotopies and introduce the degree of a map and use it to proof the fundamental theorem of algebra. 
If time permits, we will talk about the relation to bordisms and provide a generalization using the Pontryagin-Thom construction.
