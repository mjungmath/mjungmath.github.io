Homoclinic solutions have been proven to exist for certain parameter values of the suspension bridge equation. But what about more dangerous values of the parameter? Join me in this adventure filled up with excitement, dynamical systems, love, computer assisted proofs, treason and action to know how this dramatic story came to an unexpected turn. Will invariant manifolds persist close to bifurcation? Will they intersect? Only one way to find out!
