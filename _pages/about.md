![that is me]({% link assets/images/aboutme/me.jpg %} "that is me")

I am currently affiliated at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam as junior lecturer, where I am pursuing my doctorate in mathematics under the supervision of [Thomas Rot](http://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/).

My research interests range from algebraic to geometric topology with a pinch of functional analysis.
The beauty of mathematics is its artistry.
One picture can tell everything you need to know, it encompasses a whole proof, and it is simply beautiful.

Alongside, I am interested in computational mathematics, with a special emphasis on SageMath.
I contribute to the SageMath project, primarily focusing on the development of the sub-project SageManifolds.
For more detailed information about my contributions, please click [here]({% link _pages/sagemanifolds.md %}).

I am also organizer of the [nutshell seminar]({% link _pages/nutshell.md %}) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
