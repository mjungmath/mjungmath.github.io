![that is me]({% link assets/images/aboutme/me.jpg %} "that is me")

I am currently affiliated at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam as junior lecturer, where I am pursuing my doctorate in mathematics under the supervision of [Thomas Rot](http://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/).

My research interests range from algebraic to geometric topology.
Basically, I like everything that can be comprised in a picture.
To me, using differentiable and geometric structures to derive topological properties radiates a certain beauty.

My current research focuses around the Pontryagin-Thom construction on finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional manifolds.
This area fascinates me as it brings various branches of mathematics harmoniously together such as algebraic topology, differential topology, differential geometry and functional analysis.

My teaching roles at the VU range from teaching assistant to lecturer.
Apart from ordinary teaching tasks, I am involved in the (re)structuring process of Bachelor programs such as mathematics and mechanical engineering.
In 2022, I received my Dutch university teaching qualification.

Alongside, I am interested in computational mathematics, with a special emphasis on SageMath.
I contribute to the SageMath project, primarily focusing on the development of the sub-project SageManifolds.
For more detailed information about my contributions, please click [here]({% link _pages/sagemanifolds.md %}).

I am also organizer of the [nutshell seminar]({% link _pages/nutshell.md %}) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
