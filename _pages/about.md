I am a junior docent and Ph.D. student at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. My Ph.D. is under the supervision of [Thomas Rot](http://www.few.vu.nl/~trt800/) in the area of differential topology. My general research interests lie in differential topology, differential geometry, computational mathematics and mathematical physics.

Moreover, I am developer in the [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) project. My main contribution is devoted to the sub-project [SageManifolds](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/).  Quite recently, I have added the Chern--Weil approach for characteristic classes.
