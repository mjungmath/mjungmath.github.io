My teaching roles at the VU range from teaching assistant to lecturer.
Apart from ordinary teaching tasks, I am actively contributing to enhancing the mechanical engineering bachelor program.
In 2022, I received my Dutch university teaching qualification.
A list of my previous and current teaching duties can be found below.
